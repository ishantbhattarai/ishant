    Ingredients:

12 ounces (about 340 grams) of spaghetti or any pasta of your choice
2 large eggs
1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan cheese)
4-6 slices of pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork), diced
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt, for pasta cooking water
Instructions:

Prepare the Pasta:

Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Season the boiling water generously with salt (about 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water).
Add the spaghetti or pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions until it's al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).
Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale:

While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. If you want to add minced garlic for extra flavor, do so in the last minute of cooking the pancetta, being careful not to burn it.
Prepare the Sauce:

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Mix well.
Combine Everything:

Once the pasta is cooked al dente, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.

Immediately, while the pasta is still hot, return it to the pot you cooked it in. Add the cooked pancetta/guanciale and any drippings from the skillet into the pot with the pasta. Mix them together.

Next, pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta and quickly toss everything together. The heat from the pasta and pancetta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a little bit of the reserved pasta cooking water gradually until you achieve the desired consistency.

Serve:

Serve the Pasta Carbonara immediately with an extra sprinkle of grated Pecorino Romano cheese and more freshly ground black pepper if desired.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Pasta Carbonara!
