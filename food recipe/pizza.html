
Ingredients:

For the Pizza Dough:

1 and 1/2 cups warm water (around 110째F or 45째C)
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
For the Pizza Toppings:

1 cup pizza sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
Your favorite pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, etc.)
Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:

1. Prepare the Pizza Dough:

In a small bowl, combine warm water, active dry yeast, and sugar. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy and activates.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.

Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.

Stir everything together until a dough forms.

Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this step.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until it has doubled in size.

2. Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.
3. Shape the Pizza:

After the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide it into two equal portions for two 12-inch pizzas or leave it whole for one large pizza.

Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.

4. Add the Toppings:

Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza peel or a baking sheet if you don't have a pizza stone.

Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.

Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.

Add your favorite toppings. Be creative!

5. Bake:

If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot stone in the preheated oven.

Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

6. Garnish and Serve:

Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.

If desired, garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese.

Slice the pizza and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade pizza!
